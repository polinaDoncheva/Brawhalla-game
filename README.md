# Brawhalla game

A multiplayer platform fighter inspired by games like Brawlhalla. 
Players choose from a diverse set of characters, landscapes and weapons with different abilities, to battle against opponents in dynamic arenas.
The goal is to knock your enemies out of the arena.
As players endure attacks, their resistance decreases, making them more vulnerable. 
Each successful hit deals greater damage and pushes the player further away from the arena.
